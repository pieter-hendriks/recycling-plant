Build the plant
	Try to run available scratch on lego bricks
	
	WouldBeNice(AlSO DO):
		Replace lego controller with PiStorm
			Tips:
				PiStorm uses python - 
					either use image for pystorm (website) 
							--> Python 2.7 -> Problem: Multi-Agent Systems is in python 3+
							--> Would have to migrate image code. 
							
							-> There exists a github branch that has started this work. Should look around. 
					PiStorm has API on raspPi OS, to handle/connect to lego
					Api not perfect. Might need little hacks here and there. 
						Sufficient for sensors and actuators.

SYSML model
	cyberphysical system: Hardware/software combo, e.g. welke software op welke pi
	Agents e.d. probably
	Hoe opdeling agent <-> sensor control
	
Implementation:
	Ev3 op pi's zetten
	Vertaling naar juiste code
	Zien dat 't werkt

Agents beginnen implementeren (SPADE)
	Link voor python3 image komt at some point, should make stuff easier.
